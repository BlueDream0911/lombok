To publish:

Make sure you up the version number, then, assuming the version number is now '0.8.1':
git tag v0.8.1
git push
git push --tags
ant publish

Then, up the version number again, to v0.8.2-HEAD, and run:
ant website

and publish the website. Or, at least:
ant changelogToHtml

and publish build/website/changelog.html

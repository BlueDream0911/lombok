'lib' is defined as those things which are required when actually running lombok.
The main lombok code requires all libraries in the 'lombok' directory, whilst the agents
require the contents of both the 'agent' directory and the agent's specific directory (e.g. 'eclipse.agent').

For dependencies which are required only at compile time, see the 'deps' directory.

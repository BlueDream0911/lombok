/**
 * Generates an implementation for the <code>toString</code> method inherited by all objects.
 * <p>
 * If the method already exists, then <code>&#64;ToString</code> will not generate any method, and instead warns
 * that it's doing nothing at all. The parameter list and return type are not relevant when deciding to skip generation of
 * the method; any method named <code>toString</code> will make <code>&#64;ToString</code> not generate anything.
 * <p>
 * All fields that are non-static are used in the toString generation. You can exclude fields by specifying them
 * in the <code>exclude</code> parameter.
 * <p>
 * Array fields are handled by way of {@link java.util.Arrays#deepToString(Object[])} where necessary.
 * The downside is that arrays with circular references (arrays that contain themselves,
 * possibly indirectly) results in calls to <code>toString</code> throwing a
 * {@link java.lang.StackOverflowError}. However, the implementations for java's own {@link java.util.ArrayList} suffer
 * from the same flaw.
 * <p>
 * The <code>toString</code> method that is generated will print the class name as well as each field. You can optionally
 * also print the names of each field, by setting the <code>includeFieldNames</code> flag to <em>true</em>.
 * <p>
 * You can also choose to include the result of <code>toString</code> in your class's superclass by setting the
 * <code>callSuper</code> to <em>true</em>.

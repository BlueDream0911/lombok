projectlombok makes java a spicier language by adding 'handlers' that know how to build and compile simple, boilerplate-free, not-quite-java code.

Using lombok is made as simple as possible, and aims to work on all major java IDEs as well as javac itself.

See LICENCE for the project lombok licence.
